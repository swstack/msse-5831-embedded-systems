# Lab 1: Counters, Timers, Scheduling

This lab is an introduction to timers, counters and crude scheduling.

### System Tasks

The system is responsible for executing tasks at a certain frequency, the following is the definition of each task:

TODO

### Experiments

We will introduce "experiments" while the system is operating which will affect the behavior of the system timing and scheduling. The experiments are defined as follows:

# Results

Each result was recorded after roughly 30 seconds of program execution.

### Default, no experiments running

Stats:
Green LED       : Completions (296) Misses (0)
Yellow LED      : Completions (294) Misses (0)
Red LED         : Completions (249) Misses (30)
Jitter LED      : Completions (815) Misses (362)
Hough Transform : Completions (294) Misses (0)

### Experiment 2

Stats:
Green LED       : Completions (294) Misses (0)
Yellow LED      : Completions (292) Misses (0)
Red LED         : Completions (208) Misses (66)
Jitter LED      : Completions (852) Misses (319)
Hough Transform : Completions (292) Misses (0)
```

**Note:** Twice as many misses for Red LED, but fewer for Jitter oddly enough.
